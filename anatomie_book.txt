The <B>anterior and posterior surfaces</B> are flattened and of equal depth; the former <!-- PAGE NUM="98" -->is placed on a lower level than the latter, and its inferior border is prolonged downward, so as to overlap the upper and forepart of the vertebra below. The <B>upper surface</B> is concave transversely, and presents a projecting lip on either side; the <B>lower surface</B> is concave from before backward, convex from side to side, and presents laterally shallow concavities which receive the corresponding projecting lips of the subjacent vertebra. The <B>pedicles</B> are directed lateralward and backward, and are attached to the body midway between its upper and lower borders, so that the superior vertebral notch is as deep as the inferior, but it is, at the same time, narrower. The <B>lamin&#230;</B> are narrow, and thinner above than below; the <B>vertebral foramen</B> is large, and of a triangular form. The <B>spinous process</B> is short and bifid, the two divisions being often of unequal size. The <B>superior</B> and <B>inferior articular processes</B> on either side are fused to form an articular pillar, which projects lateralward from the junction of the pedicle and lamina. The articular facets are flat and of an oval form: the superior look backward, upward, and slightly medialward: the inferior forward, downward, and slightly lateralward.

<TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD><B>First Cervical Vertebra.</B>&#151;The first cervical vertebra <A HREF="/107/illus86.html">(Fig. 86)</A> is named the <B>atlas</B> because it supports the globe of the head. Its chief peculiarity is that it has no body, and this is due to the fact that the body of the atlas has fused with that of the next vertebra. Its other peculiarities are that it has no spinous process, is ring-like, and consists of an anterior and a posterior arch and two lateral masses. The <B>anterior arch</B> forms about one-fifth of the ring: its anterior surface is convex, and presents at its center the <B>anterior tubercle</B> for the attachment of the Longus colli muscles; posteriorly it is concave, and marked by a smooth, oval or circular facet (<I>fovea dentis</I>), for articulation with the odontoid process (<I>dens</I>) of the axis. The upper and lower borders respectively give attachment to the anterior atlantooccipital membrane and the anterior atlantoaxial ligament; the former connects it with the occipital bone above, and the latter with the axis below. The <B>posterior arch</B> forms about two-fifths of the circumference of the ring: it ends behind in the <B>posterior tubercle,</B> which is the rudiment of a spinous process and gives origin to the Recti capitis posteriores minores. The diminutive size of this process prevents any interference with the movements between the atlas and the skull. The posterior part of the arch presents above and behind a rounded edge for the attachment of the posterior atlanto&#246;ccipital membrane, while immediately behind each superior articular process is a groove (<I>sulcus arteri&#230; vertebralis</I>), sometimes converted into a foramen by a delicate bony spiculum which arches backward from the posterior end of the superior articular process. This groove represents the superior vertebral notch, and serves for the transmission of the vertebral artery, which, after ascending through the foramen in the transverse process, winds around the lateral mass in a direction backward and medialward; it also transmits the suboccipital (first spinal) nerve. On the under surface of the posterior arch, behind the articular facets, are two shallow grooves, the <B>inferior vertebral notches.</B> The lower border gives attachment to the posterior atlantoaxial ligament, which connects it with the axis. The <B>lateral masses</B> are the most bulky and solid parts of the atlas, in order to support the weight of the head. Each carries two articular facets, a superior and an inferior. The <B>superior facets</B> are of large size, oval, concave, and approach each other in front, but diverge behind: they are directed upward, medialward, and a little backward, each forming a cup for the corresponding condyle of the occipital bone, and are admirably adapted to the nodding movements of the head. Not infrequently they are <!-- PAGE NUM="100" -->partially subdivided by indentations which encroach upon their margins. The <B>inferior articular facets</B> are circular in form, flattened or slightly convex and directed downward and medialward, articulating with the axis, and permitting the rotatory movements of the head. Just below the medial margin of each superior facet is a small tubercle, for the attachment of the transverse atlantal ligament which stretches across the ring of the atlas and divides the vertebral foramen into two unequal parts&#151;the anterior or smaller receiving the odontoid process of the axis, the posterior transmitting the medulla spinalis and its membranes. This part of the vertebral canal is of considerable size, much greater than is required for the accommodation of the medulla spinalis, and hence lateral displacement of the atlas may occur without compression of this structure. The <B>transverse processes</B> are large; they project lateralward and downward from the lateral masses, and serve for the attachment of muscles which assist in rotating the head. They are long, and their anterior and posterior tubercles are fused into one mass; the foramen transversarium is directed from below, upward and backward.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="3"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

The most distinctive characteristic of this bone is the strong odontoid process which rises perpendicularly from the upper surface of the body. The <B>body</B> is deeper in front than behind, and prolonged downward anteriorly so as to overlap the upper and fore part of the third vertebra. It presents in front a median longitudinal ridge, separating two lateral depressions for the attachment of the Longus colli muscles. Its under surface is concave from before backward and covex from side to side. The <B>dens</B> or <B>odontoid process</B> exhibits a slight constriction or neck, where it joins the body. On its anterior surface is an oval or nearly circular facet for articulation with that on the anterior arch of the atlas. On the back of the neck, and frequently extending on to its lateral surfaces, is a shallow groove for the transverse atlantal ligament which retains the process in position. The <B>apex</B> is pointed, and gives attachment to the apical odontoid ligament; below the apex the process is somewhat enlarged, and presents on either side a rough impression for the attachment of the alar ligament; these ligaments connect the process to the occipital bone. The internal structure <!-- PAGE NUM="101" -->of the odontoid process is more compact than that of the body. The <B>pedicles</B> are broad and strong, especially in front, where they coalesce with the sides of the body and the root of the odontoid process. They are covered above by the superior articular surfaces. The <B>lamin&#230;</B> are thick and strong, and the vertebral foramen large, but smaller than that of the atlas. The <B>transverse processes</B> are very small, and each ends in a single tubercle; each is perforated by the foramen transversarium, which is directed obliquely upward and lateralward. The <B>superior articular surfaces</B> are round, slightly convex, directed upward and lateralward, and are supported on the body, pedicles, and transverse processes. The <B>inferior articular surfaces</B> have the same direction as those of the other cervical vertebr&#230;. The <B>superior vertebral notches</B> are very shallow, and lie behind the articular processes; the <B>inferior</B> lie in front of the articular processes, as in the other cervical vertebr&#230;. The <B>spinous process</B> is large, very strong, deeply channelled on its under surface, and presents a bifid, tuberculated extremity.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="4"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

The portions of bone intervening between the ridges are the bodies of the sacral vertebr&#230;. The body of the first segment is of large size, and in form resembles that of a lumbar vertebra; the succeeding ones diminish from above downward, are flattened from before backward, and curved so as to accommodate themselves to the form of the sacrum, being concave in front, convex behind. At the ends of the ridges are seen the <B>anterior sacral foramina,</B> four in number on either side, somewhat rounded in form, diminishing in size from above downward, and directed lateralward and forward; they give exit to the anterior divisions of the sacral nerves and entrance to the lateral sacral arteries. Lateral to these foramina are the <B>lateral parts of the sacrum,</B> each consisting of five separate segments at an early period of life; in the adult, these are blended with the bodies and with each other.

On either side of the middle sacral crest is a shallow groove, the <B>sacral groove,</B> which gives origin to the Multifidus, the floor of the groove being formed by the united lamin&#230; of the corresponding vertebr&#230;. The lamin&#230; of the fifth sacral vertebra, and sometimes those of the fourth, fail to meet behind, and thus a hiatus or deficiency occurs in the posterior wall of the sacral canal. On the lateral aspect of the sacral groove is a linear series of tubercles produced by the fusion of the articular processes which together form the indistinct <B>sacral articular crests.</B> The articular processes of the first sacral vertebra are large and oval in shape; their facets are concave from side to side, look backward and medialward, and articulate with the facets on the inferior processes of the fifth lumbar vertebra.

The transverse tubercles of the first sacral vertebra are large and very distinct; they, together with the transverse tubercles of the second vertebra, give attachment to the horizontal parts of the posterior sacroiliac ligaments; those of the third vertebra give attachment to the oblique fasciculi of the posterior sacroiliac ligaments; and those of the fourth and fifth to the sacrotuberous ligaments.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="5"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

The ossific granules first appear in the situations where the transverse processes afterward project, and spread backward to the spinous process forward into the pedicles, and lateralward into the transverse and articular processes. Ossification of the bodies begins about the eighth week in the lower thoracic region, and subsequently extends upward and downward along the column. The center for the body does not give rise to the whole of the body of the adult vertebra, the postero-lateral portions of which are ossified by extensions from the vertebral arch centers. The body of the vertebra during the first few years of life shows, therefore, <!-- PAGE NUM="112" -->two synchondroses, <B>neurocentral synchondroses,</B> traversing it along the planes of junction of the three centers <A HREF="/107/illus102.html">(Fig. 102</A>). In the thoracic region, the facets for the heads of the ribs lie behind the neurocentral synchondroses and are ossified from the centers for the vertebral arch. At birth the vertebra consists of three pieces, the body and the halves of the vertebral arch. During the first year the halves of the arch unite behind, union taking place first in the lumbar region and then extending upward through the thoracic and cervical regions. About the third year the bodies of the upper cervical vertebr&#230; are joined to the arches on either side; in the lower lumbar vertebr&#230; the union is not completed until the sixth year. Before puberty, no other changes occur, excepting a gradual increase of these primary centers, the upper and under surfaces of the bodies and the ends of the transverse and spinous processes being cartilaginous. <!-- PAGE NUM="113" -->About the sixteenth year <A HREF="/107/illus102.html">(Fig. 102),</A> five secondary centers appear, one for the tip of each transverse process, one for the extremity of the spinous process, one for the upper and one for the lower surface of the body <A HREF="/107/illus103.html">(Fig. 103</A>).

About the sixth month of fetal life, two centers make their appearance in the base of this process: they are placed laterally, and join before birth to form a conical bilobed mass deeply cleft above; the interval between the sides of the cleft and the summit of the process is formed by a wedge-shaped piece of cartilage. The base of the process is separated from the body by a cartilaginous disk, which gradually becomes ossified at its circumference, but remains cartilaginous in its center until advanced age. In this cartilage, rudiments of the lower epiphysial lamella of the atlas and the upper epiphysial lamella of the axis may sometimes be found. The apex of the odontoid process has a separate center which appears in the second and joins about the twelfth year; this is the upper epiphysial lamella of the atlas.

<TR><TD>The vertebral column is situated in the median line, as the posterior part of the trunk; its average length in the male is about 71 cm. Of this length the cervical part measures 12.5 cm., the thoracic about 28 cm., the lumbar 18 cm., and the sacrum and coccyx 12.5 cm.

<TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD><B>Curves.</B>&#151;Viewed laterally <A HREF="/107/illus111.html">(Fig. 111),</A> the vertebral column presents several curves, which correspond to the different regions of the column, and are called cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and pelvic. The <B>cervical</B> curve, convex forward, begins at the apex of the odontoid process, and ends at the middle of the second thoracic vertebra; it is the least marked of all the curves. The <B>thoracic</B> curve, concave forward, begins at the middle of the second and ends at the middle of the twelfth thoracic vertebra. Its most prominent point behind corresponds to the spinous process of the seventh thoracic vertebra. The <B>lumbar</B> curve is more marked in the female than in the male; it begins at the middle of the last thoracic vertebra, and ends at the sacrovertebral angle. It is convex anteriorly, the convexity of the lower three vertebr&#230; being much greater than that of the upper two. The <B>pelvic</B> curve begins at the sacrovertebral articulation, and ends at the point of the coccyx; its concavity is directed downward and forward. The thoracic and pelvic curves are termed primary curves, because they alone are present during fetal life. The cervical and lumbar curves are compensatory or secondary, and are developed after birth, the former when the child is able to hold up its head (at three or four months), and to sit upright (at nine months), the latter at twelve or eighteen months, when the child begins to walk.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="2"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;The vertebral column has also a slight <B>lateral</B> curvature, the convexity of which is directed toward the right side. This may be produced by muscular action, most persons using the right arm in preference to the left, especially in making long-continued efforts, when the body is curved to the right side. In support of this explanation it has been found that in one or two individuals who were left-handed, the convexity was to the left side. By others this curvature is regarded as being produced by the aortic arch and upper part of the descending thoracic aorta&#151;a view which is supported by the fact that in cases where the viscera are transposed and the aorta is on the right side, the convexity of the curve is directed to the left side.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="3"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD><B>Posterior Surface.</B>&#151;The posterior surface of the vertebral column presents in the median line the spinous processes. In the cervical region (with the exception of the second and seventh vertebr&#230;) these are short and horizontal, with bifid extremities. In the upper part of the thoracic region they are directed obliquely downward; in the middle they are almost vertical, and in the lower part they are nearly horizontal. In the lumbar region they are nearly horizontal. The spinous processes are separated by considerable intervals in the lumbar region, by narrower intervals in the neck, and are closely approximated in the middle of the thoracic region. Occasionally one of these processes deviates a little from the median line&#151;a fact to be remembered in practice, as irregularities of this sort are attendant also on fractures or displacements of the vertebral column. On either side of the spinous processes is the <B>vertebral groove</B> formed by the lamin&#230; in the cervical and lumbar regions, where it is shallow, and by the lamin&#230; and transverse processes in the thoracic region, where it is deep and broad; these grooves lodge the deep muscles of the back. Lateral to the vertebral grooves are the articular processes, and still more laterally the transverse processes. In the thoracic region, the transverse processes stand backward, on a plane considerably behind that of the same processes in the cervical and lumbar regions. In the cervical region, the transverse processes are placed in front of the articular processes, lateral to the pedicles and between the intervertebral foramina. In the thoracic region they are posterior to the pedicles, intervertebral foramina, and articular processes. In the lumbar region they are in front of the articular processes, but behind the intervertebral foramina.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="5"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD><B>Structure.</B>&#151;The sternum is composed of highly vascular cancellous tissue, covered by a thin layer of compact bone which is thickest in the manubrium between the articular facets for the clavicles.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="11"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD><B>Ossification.</B>&#151;The sternum originally consists of two cartilaginous bars, situated one on either side of the median plane and connected with the cartilages of the upper nine ribs of its own side. These two bars fuse with each other along the middle line to form the cartilaginous sternum which is ossified from <I>six</I> centers: one for the manubrium, four for the body, and one for the xiphoid process <A HREF="/107/illus118.html">(Fig. 118)</A>. The ossific centers appear in the intervals between the articular depressions for the costal cartilages, in the following order: in the manubrium and first piece of the body, during the sixth month; in the second and third pieces of the body, during the seventh month of fetal life; in its fourth piece, during the first year after birth; and in the xiphoid process, between the fifth and eighteenth years. The centers make their appearance at the upper parts of the segments, and proceed gradually downward.<A NAME="txt20">&nbsp;</A><A HREF="/107/27.html#note20">20</A> To these may be added the occasional existence of two small episternal centers, which make their appearance one on either side of the jugular notch; they are probably vestiges of the episternal bone of the monotremata and lizards. Occasionally some of the segments are formed from more than one center, the number and position of which vary <A HREF="/107/illus120.html">(Fig. 120)</A>. Thus, the first piece may have two, three, or even six centers. When two are 
<!-- PAGE NUM="122" --> 
<!-- PAGE NUM="123" -->present, they are generally situated one above the other, the upper being the larger; the second piece has seldom more than one; the third, fourth, and fifth pieces are often formed from two centers placed laterally, the irregular union of which explains the rare occurrence of the sternal foramen <A HREF="/107/illus121.html">(Fig. 121)</A>, or of the vertical fissure which occasionally intersects this part of the bone constituting the malformation known as <I>fissura sterni;</I> these conditions are further explained by the manner in which the cartilaginous sternum is formed. More rarely still the upper end of the sternum may be divided by a fissure. Union of the various centers of the body begins about puberty, and proceeds from below upward <A HREF="/107/illus119.html">(Fig. 119)</A>; by the age of twenty-five they are all united. The xiphoid process may become joined to the body before the age of thirty, but this occurs more frequently after forty; on the other hand, it sometimes remains ununited in old age. In advanced life the manubrium is occasionally joined to the body by bone. When this takes place, however, the bony tissue is generally only superficial, the central portion of the intervening cartilage remaining unossified.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="12"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

Between it and the inferior border is a groove, the <B>costal groove,</B> for the intercostal vessels and nerve. At the back part of the bone, this groove belongs to the <!-- PAGE NUM="125" -->inferior border, but just in front of the angle, where it is deepest and broadest, it is on the internal surface. The superior edge of the groove is rounded and serves for the attachment of an Intercostalis internus; the inferior edge corresponds to the lower margin of the rib, and gives attachment to an Intercostalis externus. Within the groove are seen the orifices of numerous small foramina for nutrient vessels which traverse the shaft obliquely from before backward. The <B>superior border,</B> thick and rounded, is marked by an external and an internal lip, more distinct behind than in front, which serve for the attachment of Intercostales externus and internus.

Their breadth, as well as that of the intervals between them, diminishes from the first to the last. They are broad at their attachments to the ribs, and taper toward their sternal extremities, excepting the first two, which are of the same breadth throughout, and the sixth, seventh, and eighth, which are enlarged where their margins are in contact. They also vary in direction: the first descends a little, the second is horizontal, the third ascends slightly, while the others are angular, following the course of the ribs for a short distance, and then ascending to the sternum or preceding cartilage.

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Cervical ribs</I> derived from the seventh cervical vertebra (page 83) are of not infrequent occurrence, and are important clinically because they may give rise to obscure nervous or vascular symptoms. The cervical rib may be a mere epiphysis articulating only with the transverse process of the vertebra, but more commonly it consists of a defined head, neck, and tubercle, with or without a body. It extends lateralward, or forward and lateralward, into the posterior triangle of the neck, where it may terminate in a free end or may join the first thoracic rib, the first costal cartilage, or the sternum.<A NAME="txt24">&nbsp;</A><A HREF="/107/29.html#note24">24</A> It varies much in shape, size, direction, and mobility. If it reach far enough forward, part of the brachial plexus and the subclavian artery and vein cross over it, and are apt to suffer compression in so doing. Pressure on the artery may obstruct the circulation so much that arterial thrombosis results, causing gangrene of the finger tips. Pressure on the nerves is commoner, and affects the eighth cervical and first thoracic nerves, causing paralysis of the muscles they supply, and neuralgic pains and paresthesia in the area of skin to which they are distributed: no oculopupillary changes are to be found.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="5"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;In <I>rickets,</I> the ends of the ribs, where they join the costal cartilages, become enlarged, giving rise to the so-called &#147;rickety rosary,&#148; which in mild cases is only found on the internal surface of the thorax. Lateral to these enlargements the softened ribs sink in, so as to present a groove passing downward and lateralward on either side of the sternum. This bone is forced forward by the bending of the ribs, and the antero-posterior diameter of the chest is increased. The ribs affected are the second to the eighth, the lower ones being prevented from falling in by the presence of the liver, stomach, and spleen; and when the abdomen is distended, as it often is in rickets, the lower ribs may be pushed outward, causing a transverse groove (Harrison&#146;s sulcus) just above the costal arch. This deformity or forward projection of the sternum, often asymmetrical, is known as <I>pigeon breast,</I> and may be taken as evidence of active or old rickets except in cases of primary spinal curvature. In many instances it is associated in children with obstruction in the upper air passages, due to enlarged tonsils or adenoid growths. In some rickety children or adults, and also in others who give no history or further evidence of having had rickets, an opposite condition obtains. The lower part of the sternum and often the xiphoid process as well are deeply depressed backward, producing an oval hollow in the lower sternal and upper epigastric regions. This is known as <I>funnel breast</I> (German, <I>Trichterbrust</I>); it never appears to produce the least disturbance of any of the vital functions. The <I>phthisical chest</I> is often long and narrow, and with great obliquity of the ribs and projection of the scapul&#230;. In <I>pulmonary emphysema</I> the chest is enlarged in all its diameters, and presents on section an almost circular outline. It has received the name of the <I>barrel-shaped chest.</I> In severe cases of <I>lateral curvature of the vertebral column</I> the thorax becomes much distorted. In consequence of the rotation of the bodies of the vertebr&#230; which takes place in this disease, the ribs opposite the convexity of the dorsal curve become extremely convex behind, being thrown out and bulging, and at the same time flattened in front, so that the two ends of the same rib are almost parallel. Coincidently with this the ribs on the opposite side, on the concavity of the curve, are sunk and depressed behind, and bulging and convex in front.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="7"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;The <B>internal surface</B> is deeply concave and divided into four foss&#230; by a <B>cruciate eminence.</B> The upper two foss&#230; are triangular and lodge the occipital lobes of the cerebrum; the lower two are quadrilateral and accommodate the hemispheres of the cerebellum. At the point of intersection of the four divisions of the cruciate eminence is the <B>internal occipital protuberance.</B> From this protuberance the upper division of the cruciate eminence runs to the superior angle of the bone, and on <!-- PAGE NUM="131" -->one side of it (generally the right) is a deep groove, the <B>sagittal sulcus,</B> which lodges the hinder part of the superior sagittal sinus; to the margins of this sulcus the falx cerebri is attached. The lower division of the cruciate eminence is prominent, and is named the <B>internal occipital crest;</B> it bifurcates near the foramen magnum and gives attachment to the falx cerebelli; in the attached margin of this falx is the occipital sinus, which is sometimes duplicated. In the upper part of the internal occipital crest, a small depression is sometimes distinguishable; it is termed the <B>vermian fossa</B> since it is occupied by part of the vermis of the cerebellum. Transverse grooves, one on either side, extend from the internal occipital protuberance to the lateral angles of the bone; those grooves accommodate the transverse sinuses, and their prominent margins give attachment to the tentorium cerebelli. The groove on the right side is usually larger than that on the left, and is continuous with that for the superior sagittal sinus. Exceptions to this condition are, however, not infrequent; the left may be larger than the right or the two may be almost equal in size. The angle of union of the superior sagittal and transverse sinuses is named the <B>confluence of the sinuses</B> (<I>torcular Herophili</I><A NAME="txt25">&nbsp;</A><A HREF="/107/31.html#note25">25</A>), and its position is indicated by a depression situated on one or other side of the protuberance.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="5"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD><B>Lateral Parts (<I>pars lateralis</I>).</B>&#151;The lateral parts are situated at the sides of the foramen magnum; on their under surfaces are the <B>condyles</B> for articulation with the superior facets of the atlas. The condyles are oval or reniform in shape, and their anterior extremities, directed forward and medialward, are closer together than their posterior, and encroach on the basilar portion of the bone; the posterior extremities extend back to the level of the middle of the foramen magnum. The articular surfaces of the condyles are convex from before backward and from side to side, and look downward and lateralward. To their margins are attached the capsules of the atlanto&#246;ccipital articulations, and on the medial side of each is a rough impression or tubercle for the alar ligament. At the base of either condyle the bone is tunnelled by a short canal, the <B>hypoglossal canal</B> (<I>anterior condyloid foramen</I>). This begins on the cranial surface of the bone immediately above the foramen magnum, and is directed lateralward and forward above the condyle. It may be partially or completely divided into two by a spicule of bone; it gives exit to the hypoglossal or twelfth cerebral nerve, and entrance to a meningeal branch of the ascending pharyngeal artery. Behind either condyle is a depression, the <B>condyloid fossa,</B> which receives the posterior margin of the superior facet of the atlas when the head is bent backward; the floor of this fossa is sometimes perforated by the <B>condyloid canal,</B> through which an emissary vein passes from the transverse sinus. Extending lateralward from the posterior half of the condyle is a quadrilateral plate of bone, the <B>jugular process,</B> excavated in front by the <B>jugular notch,</B> which, in the articulated skull, forms the posterior part of the jugular foramen. The jugular notch may be divided into two by a bony spicule, the <B>intrajugular process,</B> which projects lateralward above the hypoglossal canal. The under surface of the jugular process is rough, and gives attachment to the Rectus capitis lateralis muscle and the lateral atlanto&#246;ccipital ligament; from this surface an eminence, the <B>paramastoid process,</B> sometimes projects downward, and may be of sufficient length to reach, and articulate with, the transverse process of the atlas. Laterally the jugular process presents a rough quadrilateral or triangular area which is joined to the jugular surface of the temporal bone by a plate of cartilage; after the age of twenty-five this plate tends to ossify.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="6"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;The <B>upper surface</B> of the lateral part presents an oval eminence, the <B>jugular tubercle,</B> which overlies the hypoglossal canal and is sometimes crossed by an oblique groove for the glossopharyngeal, vagus, and accessory nerves. On the <!-- PAGE NUM="132" -->upper surface of the jugular process is a deep groove which curves medialward and forward and is continuous with the jugular notch.

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;The <B>ethmoidal notch</B> separates the two orbital plates; it is quadrilateral, and filled, in the articulated skull, by the cribriform plate of the ethmoid. The margins of the notch present several half-cells which, when united with corresponding half-cells on the upper surface of the ethmoid, complete the ethmoidal air cells. Two grooves cross these edges transversely; they are converted into the <B>anterior</B> <!-- PAGE NUM="138" -->and <B>posterior ethmoidal canals</B> by the ethmoid, and open on the medial wall of the orbit. The anterior canal transmits the nasociliary nerve and anterior ethmoidal vessels, the posterior, the posterior ethmoidal nerve and vessels. In front of the ethmoidal notch, on either side of the frontal spine, are the openings of the <B>frontal air sinuses.</B> These are two irregular cavities, which extend backward, upward, and lateralward for a variable distance between the two tables of the skull; they are separated from one another by a thin bony septum, which often deviates to one or other side, with the result that the sinuses are rarely symmetrical. Absent at birth, they are usually fairly well-developed between the seventh and eighth years, but only reach their full size after puberty. They vary in size in different persons, and are larger in men than in women.<A NAME="txt29">&nbsp;</A><A HREF="/107/33.html#note29">29</A> They are lined by mucous membrane, and each communicates with the corresponding nasal cavity by means of a passage called the <B>frontonasal duct.</B></TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="6"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

The orbital portion is thin, translucent, and composed entirely of compact bone; hence the facility with which instruments can penetrate the cranium through this part of the orbit; when the frontal sinuses are exceptionally large they may extend backward for a considerable distance into the orbital portion, which in such cases also consists of only two tables.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="8"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

The spine is ossified from a pair of <I>secondary</I> centers, on either side of the middle line; similar centers appear in the nasal part and zygomatic processes. At birth the bone consists of two pieces, separated by the frontal suture, which is usually obliterated, except at its lower part, by the eighth year, but occasionally persists throughout life. It is generally maintained that the development of the frontal sinuses begins at the end of the first or beginning of the second year, but Onodi&#146;s researches indicate that development begins at birth.

<TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD><B>Surfaces.</B>&#151;Its <B>outer surface</B> <A HREF="/107/illus137.html">(Fig. 137)</A> is smooth and convex; it affords attachment to the Temporalis muscle, and forms part of the temporal fossa; on its hinder part is a vertical groove for the middle temporal artery. A curved line, the <B>temporal line,</B> or <B>supramastoid crest,</B> runs backward and upward across its posterior part; it serves for the attachment of the temporal fascia, and limits the origin of the Temporalis muscle. The boundary between the squama and the mastoid portion of the bone, as indicated by traces of the original suture, lies about 1 cm. below this line. Projecting from the lower part of the squama is a long, arched process, the <B>zygomatic process.</B> This process is at first directed lateralward, its two surfaces looking upward and downward; it then appears as if twisted inward upon itself, and runs forward, its surfaces now looking medialward and lateralward. The superior border is long, thin, and sharp, and serves for the attachment of the temporal fascia; the inferior, short, thick, and arched, has attached to it some fibers of the Masseter. The lateral surface is convex and subcutaneous; the medial is concave, and affords attachment to the Masseter. The anterior end is deeply serrated and articulates with the zygomatic bone. The posterior end is connected to the squama by two roots, the <B>anterior</B> and <B>posterior roots.</B> The posterior root, a prolongation of the upper border, is strongly marked; it runs backward above the external acoustic meatus, and is continuous with the temporal line. The anterior root, continuous with the lower border, is short but broad and strong; it is directed medialward and ends in a rounded eminence, the <B>articular tubercle</B> (<I>eminentia articularis</I>). This tubercle forms the front boundary of the mandibular fossa, <!-- PAGE NUM="140" -->and in the fresh state is covered with cartilage. In front of the articular tubercle is a small triangular area which assists in forming the infratemporal fossa; this area is separated from the outer surface of the squama by a ridge which is continuous behind with the anterior root of the zygomatic process, and in front, in the articulated skull, with the infratemporal crest on the great wing of the sphenoid. Between the posterior wall of the external acoustic meatus and the posterior root of the zygomatic process is the area called the <B>suprameatal triangle</B> (Macewen), or <B>mastoid fossa,</B> through which an instrument may be pushed into the tympanic antrum. At the junction of the anterior root with the zygomatic process is a projection for the attachment of the temporomandibular ligament; and behind the anterior root is an oval depression, forming part of the mandibular fossa, for the reception of the condyle of the mandible. The <B>mandibular fossa</B> (<I>glenoid fossa</I>) is bounded, in front, by the articular tubercle; behind, by the tympanic part of the bone, which separates it from the external acoustic meatus; it is divided into two parts by a narrow slit, the <B>petrotympanic fissure</B> (<I>Glaserian fissure</I>). The anterior part, formed by the squama, is smooth, covered in the fresh state with cartilage, and articulates with the condyle of the mandible. Behind this part of the fossa is a small conical eminence; this is the representative of a prominent tubercle which, in some mammals, descends behind the condyle of the mandible, and prevents its backward displacement. The posterior part of the mandibular fossa, formed by the tympanic part of the bone, is non-articular, and sometimes lodges a portion of the parotid gland. The petrotympanic fissure leads into the middle ear or tympanic cavity; it lodges the anterior process of the malleus, and transmits the tympanic branch of the internal maxillary artery. The chorda <!-- PAGE NUM="141" -->tympani nerve passes through a canal (<I>canal of Huguier</I>), separated from the anterior edge of the petrotympanic fissure by a thin scale of bone and situated on the lateral side of the auditory tube, in the retiring angle between the squama and the petrous portion of the temporal.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="3"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

At the upper and front part of the process they are large and irregular and contain air, but toward the lower part they diminish in size, while those at the apex of the process are frequently quite small and contain marrow; occasionally they are entirely absent, and the mastoid is then solid throughout. In addition to these a large irregular cavity is situated at the upper and front part of the bone. It is called the <B>tympanic antrum,</B> and must be distinguished from the mastoid cells, though it communicates with them. Like the mastoid cells it is filled with air and lined by a prolongation of the mucous membrane of the tympanic cavity, with which it communicates.

<TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD><B>Ossification.</B>&#151;The temporal bone is ossified from <I>eight</I> centers, exclusive of those for the internal ear and the tympanic ossicles, viz., one for the squama including the zygomatic process, one for <!-- PAGE NUM="146" -->the tympanic part, four for the petrous and mastoid parts, and two for the styloid process. Just before the close of fetal life <A HREF="/107/illus142.html">(Fig. 142)</A> the temporal bone consists of three principal parts: 1. The <I>squama</I> is ossified in membrane from a single nucleus, which appears near the root of the zygomatic process about the second month. 2. The <I>petromastoid</I> part is developed from four centers, which make their appearance in the cartilaginous ear capsule about the fifth or sixth month. One (<I>pro&#246;tic</I>) appears in the neighborhood of the eminentia arcuata, spreads in front and above the internal acoustic meatus and extends to the apex of the bone; it forms part of the cochlea, vestibule, superior semicircular canal, and medial wall of the tympanic cavity. A second (<I>opisthotic</I>) appears at the promontory on the medial wall of the tympanic cavity and surrounds the fenestra cochle&#230;; it forms the floor of the tympanic cavity and vestibule, surrounds the carotid canal, invests the lateral and lower part of the cochlea, and spreads medially below the internal acoustic meatus. A third (<I>pterotic</I>) roofs in the tympanic cavity and antrum; while the fourth (<I>epiotic</I>) appears near the posterior semicircular canal and extends to form the mastoid process (Vrolik). 3. The <I>tympanic ring</I> is an incomplete circle, in the concavity of which is a groove, the tympanic sulcus, for the attachment of the circumference of the tympanic membrane. This ring expands to form the tympanic part, and is ossified in membrane from a single center which appears about the third month. The <I>styloid process</I> is developed from the proximal part of the cartilage of the second branchial or hyoid arch by two centers: one for the proximal part, the <I>tympanohyal,</I> appears before birth; the other, comprising the rest of the process, is named the <!-- PAGE NUM="147" --><I>stylohyal,</I> and does not appear until after birth. The tympanic ring unites with the squama shortly before birth; the petromastoid part and squama join during the first year, and the tympanohyal portion of the styloid process about the same time (<A HREF="/107/illus143.html">Figs. 143,</A> <A HREF="/107/illus144.html">144</A>). The stylohyal does not unite with the rest of the bone until after puberty, and in some skulls never at all.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="26"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief subsequent changes in the temporal bone apart from increase in size are: (1) The tympanic ring extends outward and backward to form the tympanic part. This extension does not, however, take place at an equal rate all around the circumference of the ring, but occurs most rapidly on its anterior and posterior portions, and these outgrowths meet and blend, and thus, for a time, there exists in the floor of the meatus a foramen, the <I>foramen of Huschke;</I> this foramen is usually closed about the fifth year, but may persist throughout life. (2) The mandibular fossa is at first extremely shallow, and looks lateralward as well as downward; it becomes deeper and is ultimately directed downward. Its change in direction is accounted for as follows. The part of the squama which forms the fossa lies at first below the level of the zygomatic process. As, however, the base of the skull increases in width, this lower part of the squama is directed horizontally inward to contribute to the middle fossa of the skull, and its surfaces therefore come to look upward and downward; the attached portion of the zygomatic process also becomes everted, and projects like a shelf at right angles to the squama. (3) The mastoid portion is at first quite flat, and the stylomastoid foramen and rudimentary styloid process lie immediately behind the tympanic ring. With the development of the air cells the outer part of the mastoid portion grows downward and forward to form the mastoid process, and the styloid process and stylomastoid foramen now come to lie on the under surface. The descent of the foramen is necessarily accompanied by a corresponding lengthening of the facial canal. (4) The downward and forward growth of the mastoid process also pushes forward the tympanic part, so that the portion of it which formed the original floor of the meatus and contained the foramen of Huschke is ultimately found in the anterior wall. (5) The fossa subarcuata becomes filled up and almost obliterated.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="27"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

Its walls are everywhere exceedingly thin, and correspond to the nasal orbital, anterior, and infratemporal surfaces of the body of the bone. Its <B>nasal wall,</B> or <B>base,</B> presents, in the disarticulated bone, a large, irregular aperture, communicating with the nasal cavity. In the articulated skull this aperture is much reduced in size by the following bones: the uncinate process of the ethmoid above, the ethmoidal process of the inferior nasal concha below, the vertical part of the palatine behind, and a small part of the lacrimal above and in front (<A HREF="/107/illus158.html">Figs. 158,</A> <A HREF="/107/illus159.html">159</A>); the sinus communicates with the middle meatus <!-- PAGE NUM="161" -->of the nose, generally by two small apertures left between the above-mentioned bones. In the fresh state, usually only one small opening exists, near the upper part of the cavity; the other is closed by mucous membrane.

It forms a considerable part of the floor of the nose and the roof of the mouth and is much thicker in front than behind. Its <I>inferior surface</I> <A HREF="/107/illus160.html">(Fig. 160)</A> is concave, rough and uneven, and forms, with the palatine process of the opposite bone, the anterior three-fourths of the hard plate. It is perforated by numerous foramina for the passage of the nutrient vessels; is channelled at the back part of its lateral border by a groove, sometimes a canal, for the transmission of the descending palatine vessels and the anterior palatine nerve from the spheno-palatine ganglion; and presents little depressions for the lodgement of the palatine glands. When the two maxill&#230; are articulated, a funnel-shaped opening, the <B>incisive foramen,</B> is seen in the middle line, immediately behind the incisor teeth. In this opening the orifices of two lateral canals are visible; they are named the <B>incisive canals</B> or <B>foramina of Stenson;</B> through each of them passes the terminal branch of the descending palatine artery and the nasopalatine nerve. Occasionally two additional canals are present in the middle line; they are termed the <B>foramina of Scarpa,</B> and when present transmit the nasopalatine nerves, the left passing through the anterior, and the right through the posterior canal. On the under surface of the palatine process, a delicate linear suture, well seen in young skulls, may sometimes be noticed extending lateralward and forward on either side from the incisive foramen to the interval between the lateral incisor and the canine tooth. The small part in front of this suture constitutes the <B>premaxilla</B> (<I>os incisivum</I>), which in most vertebrates forms an independent bone; it includes the whole thickness of the alveolus, the corresponding part of the floor of the nose and the anterior nasal spine, and contains the sockets of the incisor teeth.

The maxillary sinus presents the appearance of a furrow on the lateral wall of the nose. In the adult the vertical diameter is the greatest, owing to the development of the alveolar process and the increase in size of the sinus.

<TR><TD><B>The Sphenoidal Process (<I>processus sphenoidalis</I>).</B>&#151;The sphenoidal process is a thin, compressed plate, much smaller than the orbital, and directed upward and medialward. It presents three surfaces and two borders. The <B>superior surface</B> articulates with the root of the pterygoid process and the under surface of the sphenoidal concha, its medial border reaching as far as the ala of the vomer; it presents a groove which contributes to the formation of the pharyngeal canal. The <B>medial surface</B> is concave, and forms part of the lateral wall of the nasal cavity. The <B>lateral surface</B> is divided into an articular and a non-articular portion: the former is rough, for articulation with the medial pterygoid plate; the latter is smooth, and forms part of the pterygopalatine fossa. The <B>anterior border</B> forms the posterior boundary of the sphenopalatine notch.

From this point ossification spreads medialward to the horizontal part, downward into the pyramidal process, and upward into the vertical part. Some authorities describe the bone as ossifying from four centers: one for the pyramidal process and portion of the vertical part behind the pterygopalatine groove; a second for the rest of the vertical and the horizontal parts; a third for the orbital, and a fourth for the sphenoidal process.

<TR><TD><B>Ossification.</B>&#151;The mandible is ossified in the fibrous membrane covering the outer surfaces of Meckel&#146;s cartilages. These cartilages form the cartilaginous bar of the mandibular arch (see p. 66), and are two in number, a right and a left. Their proximal or cranial ends are connected with the ear capsules, and their distal extremities are joined to one another at the symphysis by mesodermal tissue. They run forward immediately below the condyles and then, bending downward, lie in a groove near the lower border of the bone; in front of the canine tooth they incline upward to the symphysis. From the proximal end of each cartilage the malleus and incus, two of the bones of the middle ear, are developed; the next succeeding portion, as far as the lingula, is replaced by fibrous tissue, which persists to form the sphenomandibular ligament. Between the lingula and the canine tooth the cartilage disappears, while the portion of it below and behind the incisor teeth becomes ossified and incorporated with this part of the mandible.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="11"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

By the tenth week the portion of Meckel&#146;s cartilage which lies below and behind the incisor teeth is surrounded and invaded by the membrane bone. Somewhat later, accessory nuclei of cartilage make their appearance, viz., a wedge-shaped nucleus in the condyloid process and extending downward through the ramus; a small strip along the anterior border of the coronoid process; and smaller nuclei in the front part of both alveolar walls and along the front of the lower border of the bone. These accessory nuclei possess no separate ossific centers, but are invaded by the surrounding membrane <!-- PAGE NUM="175" -->bone and undergo absorption. The inner alveolar border, usually described as arising from a separate ossific center (<I>splenial center</I>), is formed in the human mandible by an ingrowth from the main mass of the bone. At birth the bone consists of two parts, united by a fibrous symphysis, in which ossification takes place during the first year.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="12"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>After birth</B> <A HREF="/107/illus183.html">(Fig. 183)</A> the two segments of the bone become joined at the symphysis, from below upward, in the first year; but a trace of separation may be visible in the beginning of the second year, near the alveolar margin. The body becomes elongated in its whole length, but more especially behind the mental foramen, to provide space for the three additional teeth developed in this part. The depth of the body increases owing to increased growth of the alveolar part, to afford room for the roots of the teeth, and by thickening of the subdental portion which enables the jaw to withstand the powerful action of the masticatory muscles; but the alveolar portion is the deeper of the two, and, consequently, the chief part of the body lies above the oblique line. The mandibular canal, after the second dentition, is situated just above the level of the mylohyoid line; and the mental foramen occupies the position usual to it in the adult. The angle becomes less obtuse, owing to the separation of the jaws by the teeth; about the fourth year it is 140&#176;.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="16"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

It is formed by the palatine processes of the maxill&#230; and palatine bones, the vomer, the pterygoid processes, the under surfaces of the great wings, spinous processes, and part of the body of the sphenoid, the under surfaces of the squam&#230; and mastoid and petrous portions of the temporals, and the under surface of the occipital bone. The anterior part or hard palate projects below the level of the rest of the surface, and is bounded in front and laterally by the alveolar arch containing the sixteen teeth of the maxill&#230;. Immediately behind the incisor teeth is the <B>incisive foramen.</B> In this foramen are two lateral apertures, the openings of the <B>incisive canals</B> (<I>foramina of Stenson</I>) which transmit the anterior branches of the descending palatine vessels, and the nasopalatine nerves. Occasionally two additional canals are present in the incisive foramen; they are termed the <B>foramina of Scarpa</B> and are situated in the middle line; when present they transmit the nasopalatine nerves. The vault of the hard palate is concave, uneven, perforated by numerous foramina, marked by depressions for the palatine glands, and traversed by a crucial suture formed by the junction of the four bones of which it is composed. In the young skull a suture may be seen extending on either side from the incisive foramen to the interval between the lateral incisor and canine teeth, and marking off the os incisivum or premaxillary bone. At either posterior angle of the hard palate is the <B>greater palatine foramen,</B> for the transmission of the descending palatine vessels and anterior palatine nerve; and running forward and medialward from it a groove, for the same vessels and nerve. Behind the posterior palatine foramen is the <B>pyramidal process of the palatine bone,</B> perforated by one or more <B>lesser palatine foramina,</B> and marked by the commencement of a transverse ridge, for the attachment of the tendinous expansion of the Tensor veli palatini. Projecting backward from the center of the posterior border of the hard palate is the <B>posterior nasal spine,</B> for the attachment of the Musculus uvul&#230;. Behind and above the hard palate are the <B>choan&#230;,</B> measuring about 2.5 cm. in their vertical and 1.25 cm. in their transverse diameters. They are separated from one another by the vomer, and each is bounded above by the body of the sphenoid, below by the horizontal part of the palatine bone, and laterally by the medial pterygoid plate of the sphenoid. At the superior border of the vomer may be seen the expanded al&#230; of this bone, receiving between them the rostrum of the sphenoid.

At the base of the lateral pterygoid plate is the <B>foramen ovale,</B> for the transmission of the mandibular nerve, the accessory meningeal artery, and sometimes the lesser superficial petrosal nerve; behind this are the <B>foramen spinosum</B> which transmits the middle meningeal vessels, and the prominent <B>spina angularis</B> (<I>sphenoidal spine</I>), which gives attachment to the sphenomandibular ligament and the Tensor veli palatini. Lateral to the spina angularis is the <B>mandibular fossa,</B> divided into two parts by the <B>petrotympanic fissure;</B> the anterior portion, concave, smooth bounded in front by the <B>articular tubercle,</B> <!-- PAGE NUM="181" -->serves for the articulation of the condyle of the mandible; the posterior portion, rough and bounded behind by the tympanic part of the temporal, is sometimes occupied by a part of the parotid gland. Emerging from between the lamin&#230; of the vaginal process of the tympanic part is the <B>styloid process;</B> and at the base of this process is the <B>stylomastoid foramen,</B> for the exit of the facial nerve, and entrance of the stylomastoid artery. Lateral to the stylomastoid foramen, between the tympanic part and the mastoid process, is the <B>tympanomastoid fissure,</B> for the auricular branch of the vagus. Upon the medial side of the mastoid process is the <B>mastoid notch</B> for the posterior belly of the Digastricus, and medial to the notch, the <B>occipital groove</B> for the occipital artery. At the base of the medial pterygoid plate is a large and somewhat triangular aperture, the <B>foramen lacerum,</B> bounded in front by the great wing of the sphenoid, behind by the apex of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and medially by the body of the sphenoid and basilar portion of the occipital bone; it presents in front the posterior orifice of the <B>pterygoid canal;</B> behind, the aperture of the <B>carotid canal.</B> The lower part of this opening is filled up in the fresh state by a fibrocartilaginous plate, across the upper or cerebral surface of which the internal carotid artery passes. Lateral to this aperture is a groove, the <B>sulcus tub&#230; auditiv&#230;,</B> between the petrous part of the temporal and the great wing of the sphenoid. This sulcus is directed lateralward and backward from the root of the medial pterygoid plate and lodges the cartilaginous part of the auditory tube; it is continuous behind with the canal in the temporal bone which forms the bony part of the same tube. At the bottom of this sulcus is a narrow cleft, the <B>petrosphenoidal fissure,</B> which is occupied, in the fresh condition, by a plate of cartilage. Behind this fissure is the under surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, presenting, near its apex, the quadrilateral rough surface, part of which affords attachment to the Levator veli palatini; lateral to this surface is the orifice of the <B>carotid canal,</B> and medial to it, the depression leading to the <B>aqu&#230;ductus cochle&#230;,</B> the former transmitting the internal carotid artery and the carotid plexus of the sympathetic, the latter serving for the passage of a vein from the cochlea. Behind the carotid canal is the <B>jugular foramen,</B> a large aperture, formed in front by the petrous portion of the temporal, and behind by the occipital; it is generally larger on the right than on the left side, and may be subdivided into three compartments. The anterior compartment transmits the inferior petrosal sinus; the intermediate, the glossopharyngeal, vagus, and accessory nerves; the posterior, the transverse sinus and some meningeal branches from the occipital and ascending pharyngeal arteries. On the ridge of bone dividing the carotid canal from the jugular foramen is the <B>inferior tympanic canaliculus</B> for the transmission of the tympanic branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve; and on the wall of the jugular foramen, near the root of the styloid process, is the <B>mastoid canaliculus</B> for the passage of the auricular branch of the vagus nerve. Extending forward from the jugular foramen to the foramen lacerum is the <B>petro&#246;ccipital fissure</B> occupied, in the fresh state, by a plate of cartilage. Behind the basilar portion of the occipital bone is the <B>foramen magnum,</B> bounded laterally by the occipital condyles, the medial sides of which are rough for the attachment of the alar ligaments. Lateral to each condyle is the <B>jugular process</B> which gives attachment to the Rectus capitis lateralis muscle and the lateral atlanto&#246;ccipital ligament. The foramen magnum transmits the medulla oblongata and its membranes, the accessory nerves, the vertebral arteries, the anterior and posterior spinal arteries, and the ligaments connecting the occipital bone with the axis. The mid-points on the anterior and posterior margins of the foramen magnum are respectively termed the <B>basion</B> and the <B>opisthion.</B> In front of each condyle is the canal for the passage of the hypoglossal nerve and a meningeal artery. Behind each condyle is the <B>condyloid fossa,</B> perforated on one or both sides by the condyloid canal, for the transmission of a vein from the transverse sinus. Behind the foramen magnum <!-- PAGE NUM="182" -->is the <B>median nuchal line</B> ending above at the <B>external occipital protuberance,</B> while on either side are the <B>superior</B> and <B>inferior nuchal lines;</B> these, as well as the surfaces of bone between them, are rough for the attachment of the muscles which are enumerated on pages 129 and 130.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="4"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

The cranium is somewhat ovoid in shape, but its contour varies in different cases and depends largely on the length and height of the skull and on the degree of prominence of the superciliary arches and frontal eminences. Entering into its formation are the frontal, the parietal, the occipital, the temporal, and the great wing of the sphenoid. These bones are joined to one another and to the zygomatic by the following <B>sutures:</B> the <B>zygomaticotemporal</B> between the zygomatic process of the temporal and the temporal process of the zygomatic; the <B>zygomaticofrontal</B> uniting the zygomatic bone with the zygomatic process of the frontal; the sutures surrounding the great wing of the sphenoid, viz., the <B>sphenozygomatic</B> in front, the <B>sphenofrontal</B> and <B>sphenoparietal</B> above, and the <B>sphenosquamosal</B> behind. The sphenoparietal suture varies in length in different skulls, and is absent in those cases where the frontal articulates with the temporal squama. The point corresponding with the posterior end of the sphenoparietal suture is named the <B>pterion;</B> it is situated about 3 cm. behind, and a little above the level of the zygomatic process of the frontal bone.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="5"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;The <B>squamosal suture</B> arches backward from the pterion and connects the temporal squama with the lower border of the parietal: this suture is continuous behind with the short, nearly horizontal <B>parietomastoid suture,</B> which unites the mastoid process of the temporal with the region of the mastoid angle of the parietal. Extending from above downward and forward across the cranium are the <B>coronal</B> and <B>lambdoidal sutures;</B> the former connects the parietals with the frontal, the latter, the parietals with the occipital. The lambdoidal suture is continuous below with the <B>occipitomastoid suture</B> between the occipital and the mastoid portion of the temporal.

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;The <B>zygomatic arch</B> is formed by the zygomatic process of the temporal and the temporal process of the zygomatic, the two being united by an oblique suture; the tendon of the Temporalis passes medial to the arch to gain insertion into the coronoid process of the mandible. The zygomatic process of the temporal arises by two roots, an anterior, directed inward in front of the mandibular fossa, where it expands to form the articular tubercle, and a posterior, which runs backward above the external acoustic meatus and is continuous with the supramastoid crest. The upper border of the arch gives attachment to the temporal fascia; the lower border and medial surface give origin to the Masseter.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="8"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

The small triangular area between the posterior root of the zygomatic arch and the postero-superior part of the orifice is termed the <B>suprameatal triangle,</B> on the anterior border of which a small spinous process, the <B>suprameatal spine,</B> is sometimes seen.

The anterior and larger part of the fossa articulates with the condyle of the mandible and is limited behind by the external acoustic meatus: the posterior part sometimes lodges a portion of the parotid gland. The styloid process extends downward and forward for a variable distance from the lower part of the tympanic part, and gives attachment to the Styloglossus, Stylohyoideus, and Stylopharyngeus, and to the stylohyoid and stylomandibular ligaments. Projecting downward behind the external acoustic meatus is the mastoid process, to the outer surface of which the Sternocleidomastoideus, Splenius capitis, and Longissimus capitis are attached.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="9"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;The lateral parts of the middle fossa are of considerable depth, and support the temporal lobes of the brain. They are marked by depressions for the brain convolutions and traversed by furrows for the anterior and posterior branches of the middle meningeal vessels. These furrows begin near the foramen spinosum, and the anterior runs forward and upward to the sphenoidal angle of the parietal, where it is sometimes converted into a bony canal; the posterior runs lateralward and backward across the temporal squama and passes on to the parietal near the middle of its lower border. The following apertures are also to be seen. In front is the <B>superior orbital fissure,</B> bounded above by the small wing, below, by the great wing, and medially, by the body of the sphenoid; it is usually completed laterally by the orbital plate of the frontal bone. It transmits to the orbital cavity the oculomotor, the trochlear, the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal, and the abducent nerves, some filaments from the cavernous plexus of the sympathetic, and the orbital branch of the middle meningeal artery; and from the orbital cavity a recurrent branch from the lacrimal artery to the dura mater, and the ophthalmic veins. Behind the medial end of the superior orbital fissure is the <B>foramen rotundum,</B> for the passage of the maxillary nerve. Behind and lateral to the foramen rotundum is the <B>foramen ovale,</B> which transmits the mandibular nerve, the accessory meningeal artery, and the lesser superficial petrosal nerve.<A NAME="txt50">&nbsp;</A><A HREF="/107/47.html#note50">50</A> Medial to the foramen ovale is the <B>foramen Vesalii,</B> which varies in size in different individuals, and is often absent; when present, it opens below at the lateral side of the scaphoid fossa, and transmits a small vein. Lateral to the foramen ovale is the <B>foramen spinosum,</B> for the passage of the middle meningeal vessels, and a recurrent branch from the mandibular nerve. Medial to the foramen ovale is the <B>foramen lacerum;</B> in the fresh state the lower part of this aperture is filled up by a layer of fibrocartilage, while its upper and inner parts transmit the internal carotid artery surrounded by a plexus of sympathetic nerves.

<TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD><B>The Posterior Fossa (<I>fossa cranii posterior</I>).</B>&#151;The posterior fossa is the largest and deepest of the three. It is formed by the dorsum sell&#230; and clivus of the sphenoid, the occipital, the petrous and mastoid portions of the temporals, and the mastoid angles of the parietal bones; it is crossed by the <B>occipitomastoid</B> and the <B>parietomastoid sutures,</B> and lodges the cerebellum, pons, and medulla oblongata. It is separated from the middle fossa in and near the median line by the dorsum sell&#230; of the sphenoid and on either side by the superior angle of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. This angle gives attachment to the tentorum cerebelli, is grooved for the superior petrosal sinus, and presents at its medial end a notch upon which the trigeminal nerve rests. The fossa is limited behind by the grooves for the transverse sinuses. In its center is the <B>foramen magnum,</B> on either side of which is a rough tubercle for the attachment of the alar ligaments; a little above this tubercle is the canal, which transmits the hypoglossal nerve and a meningeal branch from the ascending pharyngeal artery. In front of the foramen magnum <!-- PAGE NUM="193" -->the basilar portion of the occipital and the posterior part of the body of the sphenoid form a grooved surface which supports the medulla oblongata and pons; in the young skull these bones are joined by a synchondrosis. This grooved surface is separated on either side from the petrous portion of the temporal by the <B>petro-occipital fissure,</B> which is occupied in the fresh state by a plate of cartilage; the fissure is continuous behind with the jugular foramen, and its margins are grooved for the inferior petrosal sinus. The <B>jugular foramen</B> is situated between the lateral part of the occipital and the petrous part of the temporal. The anterior portion of this foramen transmits the inferior petrosal sinus; the posterior portion, the transverse sinus and some meningeal branches from the occipital and ascending pharyngeal arteries; and the intermediate portion, the glossopharyngeal, vagus, and accessory nerves. Above the jugular foramen is the <B>internal acoustic meatus,</B> for the facial and acoustic nerves and internal auditory artery; behind and lateral to this is the slit-like opening leading into the aqu&#230;ductus vestibuli, which lodges the ductus endolymphaticus; while between these, and near the superior angle of the petrous portion, is a small triangular depression, the remains of the fossa subarcuata, which lodges a process of the dura mater and occasionally transmits a small vein. Behind the foramen magnum are the <B>inferior occipital foss&#230;,</B> which support the hemispheres of the cerebellum, separated from one another by the <B>internal occipital crest,</B> which serves for the attachment of the falx cerebelli, and lodges the occipital sinus. The posterior foss&#230; are surmounted by the deep grooves for the <B>transverse sinuses.</B> Each of these channels, in its passage to the jugular foramen, grooves the occipital, the mastoid angle of the parietal, the mastoid portion of the temporal, and the jugular process of the occipital, and ends at the back part of the jugular foramen. Where this sinus grooves the mastoid portion of the temporal, the orifice of the <B>mastoid foramen</B> may be seen; and, just previous to its termination, the <B>condyloid canal</B> opens into it; neither opening is constant.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="7"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

On this wall are three irregular anteroposterior passages, termed the superior, middle, and inferior meatuses of the nose. The <B>superior meatus,</B> the smallest of the three, occupies the middle third of the lateral wall. It lies between the superior and middle nasal conch&#230;; the <B>sphenopalatine foramen</B> opens into it behind, and the <B>posterior ethmoidal cells</B> in front. The sphenoidal sinus opens into a recess, the <B>sphenoethmoidal recess,</B> which is placed above and behind the superior concha. The <B>middle meatus</B> is situated between the middle and inferior conch&#230;, and extends from the anterior to the posterior end of the latter.

Growth is slow from the seventh year until the approach <!-- PAGE NUM="197" -->of puberty, when a second period of activity occurs: this results in an increase in all directions, but it is especially marked in the frontal and facial regions, where it is associated with the development of the air sinuses.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="18"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;Obliteration of the sutures of the vault of the skull takes place as age advances. This process may commence between the ages of thirty and forty, and is first seen on the inner surface, and some ten years later on the outer surface of the skull. The dates given are, however, only approximate, as it is impossible to state with anything like accuracy the time at which the sutures are closed. Obliteration usually occurs first in the posterior part of the sagittal suture, next in the coronal, and then in the lambdoidal.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="19"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;In old age the skull generally becomes thinner and lighter, but in a small proportion of cases it increases in thickness and weight, owing to an hypertrophy of the inner table. The most striking feature of the old skull is the diminution in the size of the maxill&#230; and mandible consequent on the loss of the teeth and the absorption of the alveolar processes. This is associated with a marked reduction in the vertical measurement of the face and with an alteration in the angles of the mandible.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="20"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD><B>Sexual Differences in the Skull</B>Until the age of puberty there is little difference between the skull of the female and that of the male. The skull of an adult female is, as a rule, lighter and smaller, and its cranial capacity about 10 per cent. less, than that of the male. Its walls are thinner and its muscular ridges less strongly marked; the glabella, superciliary arches, and mastoid processes are less prominent, and the corresponding air sinuses are small or rudimentary. The upper margin of the orbit is sharp, the forehead vertical, the frontal and parietal eminences prominent, and the vault somewhat flattened. The contour of the face is more rounded, the facial bones are smoother, and the maxill&#230; and mandible and their contained teeth smaller. From what has been said it will be seen that more of the infantile characteristics are retained in the skull of the adult female than in that of the adult male. A well-marked male or female skull can easily be recognized as such, but in some cases the respective characteristics are so indistinct that the determination of the sex may be difficult or impossible.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="21"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;In comparing the shape of one skull with that of another it is necessary to adopt some definite position in which the skulls should be placed during the process of examination. They should be so placed that a line carried through the lower margin of the orbit and upper margin of the external acoustic meatus is in the horizontal plane. The norm&#230; of one skull can then be compared with those of another, and the differences in contour and surface form noted. Further, it is necessary that the various linear measurements used to determine the shape of the skull should be made between definite and easily localized points on its surface.

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief function of the skull is to protect the brain, and therefore those portions of the skull which are most exposed to external violence are thicker than those which are shielded from injury by overlying muscles. Thus, the skull-cap is thick and dense, whereas the temporal squam&#230; being protected by the temporales muscles, and the inferior occipital foss&#230;, being shielded by the muscles at the back of the neck, are thin and fragile. Fracture of the skull is further prevented by its elasticity, its rounded shape, and its construction of a number of secondary elastic arches, each made up of a single bone. The manner in which vibrations are transmitted through the bones of the skull is also of importance as regards its protective mechanism, at all events as far as the base is concerned. In the vault, the bones being of a fairly equal thickness and density, vibrations are transmitted in a uniform manner in all directions, but in the base, owing to the varying thickness and density of the bones, this is not so; and therefore in this situation there are special buttresses which serve to carry the vibrations in certain definite directions. At the front of the skull, on either side, is the ridge which separates the anterior from the middle fossa of the base; and behind, the ridge or buttress which separates the middle from the posterior fossa; and if any violence is applied to the vault, the vibrations would be carried along these buttresses to the sella turcica, where they meet. This part has been termed the &#147;center of resistance,&#148; and here there is a special protective mechanism to guard the brain. The subarachnoid cavity at the base of the brain is dilated, and the cerebrospinal fluid which fills it acts as a water cushion to shield the brain from injury. In like manner, when violence is applied to the base of the skull, as in falls upon the feet, the vibrations are carried backward through the occipital crest, and forward through the basilar part of the occipital and body of the sphenoid to the vault of the skull.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="58"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;58</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the bones of the face a common malformation is <I>cleft palate.</I> The cleft usually starts posteriorly, and its most elementary form is a bifid uvula; or the cleft may extend through the soft palate; or the posterior part of the whole of the hard palate may be involved, the cleft extending as far forward as the incisive foramen. In the severest forms, the cleft extends through the alveolus and passes between the incisive or premaxillary bone and the rest of the maxilla; that is to say, between the lateral incisor and canine teeth. In some instances, the cleft runs between the central and lateral incisor teeth; and this has induced some anatomists to believe that the premaxillary bone is developed from two centers <A HREF="/107/illus199.html">(Fig. 199)</A> and not from one, as was stated on p. 163. The medial segment, bearing a central incisor, is called an <I>endognathion;</I> the lateral segment, bearing the lateral incisor, is called a <I>mesognathion.</I> The cleft may affect one or both sides; if the latter, the central part is frequently displaced forward and remains united to the septum of the nose, the deficiency in the alveolus being complicated with a cleft <!-- PAGE NUM="200" -->in the lip (hare-lip). On examining a cleft palate in which the alveolus is not implicated, the cleft will generally appear to be in the median line, but occasionally is unilateral and in some cases bilateral. To understand this it must be borne in mind that three processes are concerned in the formation of the palate&#151;the palatine processes of the two maxill&#230;, which grow in horizontally and unite in the middle line, and the ethmovomerine process, which grows downward from the base of the skull and frontonasal process to unite with the palatine processes in the middle line. In those cases where the palatine processes fail to unite with each other and with the medial process, the cleft of the palate is median; where one palatine process unites with the medial septum, the other failing to do so, the cleft in the palate is unilateral. In some cases where the palatine processes fail to meet in the middle, the ethmovomerine process grows downward between them and thus produces a bilateral cleft. Occasionally there may be a hole in the middle line of the hard palate, the anterior part of the hard and the soft palate being perfect; this is rare, because, as a rule, the union of the various processes progresses from before backward, and therefore the posterior part of the palate is more frequently defective than the anterior.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="59"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;59</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

The <B>posterior</B> or <B>cervical surface</B> is smooth, and looks backward toward the root of the neck. It is limited, above, by the superior border; below, by the subclavian border; medially, by the margin of the sternal extremity; and laterally, by the coracoid tuberosity. It is concave medio-laterally, <!-- PAGE NUM="202" -->and is in relation, by its lower part, with the transverse scapular vessels. This surface, at the junction of the curves of the bone, is also in relation with the brachial plexus of nerves and the subclavian vessels. It gives attachment, near the sternal extremity, to part of the Sternohyoideus; and presents, near the middle, an oblique foramen directed lateralward, which transmits the chief nutrient artery of the bone.

The ridges give attachment to the tendinous insertions, and the surfaces between them to the fleshy fibers, of the Subscapularis. The lateral third of the fossa is smooth and covered by the fibers of this muscle. The fossa is separated from the vertebral border by smooth triangular areas at the medial and inferior angles, and in the interval between these by a narrow ridge which is often deficient. These triangular areas and the intervening ridge afford attachment to the Serratus anterior. At the upper part of the fossa is a transverse depression, where the bone appears to be bent on itself <!-- PAGE NUM="203" -->along a line at right angles to and passing through the center of the glenoid cavity, forming a considerable angle, called the <B>subscapular angle;</B> this gives greater strength to the body of the bone by its arched form, while the summit of the arch serves to support the spine and acromion.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="2"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;The <B>dorsal surface</B> <A HREF="/107/illus203.html">(Fig. 203)</A> is arched from above downward, and is subdivided into two unequal parts by the spine; the portion above the spine is called the <B>supraspinatous fossa,</B> and that below it the <B>infraspinatous fossa.</B></TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="3"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;The <B>infraspinatous fossa</B> is much larger than the preceding; toward its vertebral margin a shallow concavity is seen at its upper part; its center presents a prominent convexity, while near the axillary border is a deep groove which runs from the upper toward the lower part.

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;The dorsal surface is marked near the axillary border by an elevated ridge, which runs from the lower part of the glenoid cavity, downward and backward to the vertebral border, about 2.5 cm. above the inferior angle. The ridge serves for the attachment of a fibrous septum, which separates the Infraspinatus from the Teres major and Teres minor. The surface between the ridge and the axillary border is narrow in the upper two-thirds of its extent, and is crossed near its center by a groove for the passage of the scapular circumflex vessels; it affords attachment to the Teres minor. Its lower third presents a broader, somewhat triangular surface, which gives origin to the Teres major, and over which the Latissimus dorsi glides; frequently the latter muscle takes origin by a few fibers from this part. The broad and narrow portions above alluded to are separated by an oblique line, which runs from the axillary border, downward and backward, to meet the elevated ridge: to it is attached a fibrous septum which separates the Teres muscles from each other.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="6"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD><B>The Spine (<I>spina scapul&#230;</I>).</B>&#151;The spine is a prominent plate of bone, which crosses obliquely the medial four-fifths of the dorsal surface of the scapula at its upper part, and separates the supra- from the infraspinatous fossa. It begins at the vertical border by a smooth, triangular area over which the tendon of insertion of the lower part of the Trapezius glides, and, gradually becoming more elevated, ends in the acromion, which overhangs the shoulder-joint. The spine is triangular, and flattened from above downward, its apex being directed toward the vertebral border. It presents two surfaces and three borders. Its <B>superior surface</B> is concave; it assits in forming the supraspinatous fossa, and gives origin to part of the Supraspinatus. Its <B>inferior surface</B> forms part of the infraspinatous fossa, gives origin to a portion of the Infraspinatus, and presents near its center the orifice of a nutrient canal. Of the three borders, the <B>anterior</B> is attached to the dorsal surface of the bone; the <B>posterior,</B> or <B>crest of the spine,</B> is broad, and presents two lips and an intervening rough interval. The Trapezius is attached to the superior lip, and a rough tubercle is generally seen on that portion of the spine which receives the tendon of insertion of the lower part of this muscle. The Deltoideus is attached to the whole length of the inferior lip. The interval between the lips is subcutaneous and partly covered by the tendinous fibers of these muscles. The <B>lateral border,</B> or <B>base,</B> the shortest of the three, is slightly concave; its edge, thick and round, is continuous above with the under surface of the acromion, below with the neck of the scapula.

At its lateral part is a deep, semicircular notch, the <B>scapular notch,</B> <!-- PAGE NUM="205" -->formed partly by the base of the coracoid process. This notch is converted into a foramen by the superior transverse ligament, and serves for the passage of the suprascapular nerve; sometimes the ligament is ossified. The adjacent part of the superior border affords attachment to the Omohyoideus. The <B>axillary border</B> is the thickest of the three. It begins above at the lower margin of the glenoid cavity, and inclines obliquely downward and backward to the inferior angle. Immediately below the glenoid cavity is a rough impression, the <B>infraglenoid tuberosity,</B> about 2.5 cm. in length, which gives origin to the long head of the Triceps brachii; in front of this is a longitudinal groove, which extends as far as the <!-- PAGE NUM="206" -->lower third of this border, and affords origin to part of the Subscapularis. The inferior third is thin and sharp, and serves for the attachment of a few fibers of the Teres major behind, and of the Subscapularis in front. The <B>vertebral border</B> is the longest of the three, and extends from the medial to the inferior angle. It is arched, intermediate in thickness between the superior and the axillary borders, and the portion of it above the spine forms an obtuse angle with the part below. This border presents an anterior and a posterior lip, and an intermediate narrow area. The anterior lip affords attachment to the Serratus anterior; the posterior lip, to the Supraspinatus above the spine, the Infraspinatus below; the area between the two lips, to the Levator scapul&#230; above the triangular surface at the commencement of the spine, to the Rhomboideus minor on the edge of that surface, and to the Rhomboideus major below it; this last is attached by means of a fibrous arch, connected above to the lower part of the triangular surface at the base of the spine, and below to the lower part of the border.</</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="10"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ossification of the body begins about the second month of fetal life, by the formation of an irregular quadrilateral plate of bone, immediately behind the glenoid cavity. This plate extends so as to form the chief part of the bone, the spine growing up from its dorsal surface about the third month. At birth, a large part of the scapula is osseous, but the glenoid cavity, the coracoid process, the acromion, the vertebral border, and the inferior angle are cartilaginous. From the fifteenth to the eighteenth month after birth, ossification takes place in the middle of the coracoid process, which as a rule becomes joined with the rest of the bone about the fifteenth year. Between the fourteenth and twentieth years, ossification of the remaining parts takes place in quick succession, and usually in the following order; first, in the root of the coracoid process, in the form of a broad scale; secondly, near the base of the acromion; thirdly, in the inferior angle and contiguous part of the vertebral border; fourthly, near the extremity of the acromion; fifthly, in the vertebral border. The base of the acromion is formed by an extension from the spine; the two separate nuclei of the acromion unite, and then join with the extension from the spine. The upper third of the glenoid cavity is ossified from a separate center (subcoracoid), which makes its appearance between the tenth and eleventh years and joins between the sixteenth and the eighteenth. Further, an epiphysical plate appears for the lower part of the glenoid cavity, while the tip of the coracoid process frequently presents a separate nucleus. These various epiphyses are joined to the bone by the twenty-fifth year. Failure of bony union between the acromion and spine sometimes occurs, the junction being effected by fibrous tissue, or by an imperfect articulation; in some cases of supposed fracture of the acromion with ligamentous union, it is probable that the detached segment was never united to the rest of the bone.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="15"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD><B>The Lower Extremity.</B>&#151;The lower extremity is flattened from before backward, and curved slightly forward; it ends below in a broad, articular surface, which is divided into two parts by a slight ridge. Projecting on either side are the lateral and medial epicondyles. The <B>articular surface</B> extends a little lower than the epicondyles, and is curved slightly forward; its medial extremity occupies a lower level than the lateral. The lateral portion of this surface consists of a smooth, rounded eminence, named the <B>capitulum of the humerus;</B> it articulates with the cupshaped depression on the head of the radius, and is limited to the front and lower part of the bone. On the medial side of this eminence is a shallow groove, in which is received the medial margin of the head of the radius. Above the front part of the capitulum is a slight depression, the <B>radial fossa,</B> which receives the anterior border of the head of the radius, when the forearm is flexed. The medial portion of the articular surface is named the <B>trochlea,</B> and presents a deep depression between two well-marked borders; it is convex from before backward, concave from side to side, and occupies the anterior, lower, and posterior parts of the extremity. The lateral border separates it from the groove which articulates with the margin of the head of the radius. The medial border is thicker, of greater length, and consequently more prominent, than the lateral. The grooved portion of the articular surface fits accurately within the semilunar notch of the ulna; it is broader and deeper on the posterior than on the anterior aspect of the bone, and is inclined obliquely downward and forward toward the medial side. Above the front part of the trochlea is a small depression, the <B>coronoid fossa,</B> which receives the coronoid process of the ulna during flexion of the forearm. Above the back part of the trochlea is a deep triangular depression, the <B>olecranon fossa,</B> in which the summit of the olecranon is received in extension of the forearm. These foss&#230; are separated from one another by a thin, transparent lamina of bone, which is sometimes perforated by a <B>supratrochlear foramen;</B> they are lined in the fresh state by the synovial membrane of the elbow-joint, and their margins afford attachment to the anterior and posterior ligaments of this articulation. The <B>lateral epicondyle</B> is a small, tuberculated eminence, curved a little forward, and giving attachment to the radial collateral ligament of the elbow-joint, and to a tendon common to the origin of the Supinator and some of the Extensor muscles. The <B>medial epicondyle,</B> larger and more prominent than the lateral, is directed a little backward; it gives attachment to the ulnar collateral ligament of the elbow-joint, to the Pronator teres, and to a common tendon of origin of some of the Flexor muscles of the forearm; the ulnar nerve runs in a groove on the back of this epicondyle.

The center for the body appears near the middle of the bone in the eighth week of fetal life, and soon extends toward the extremities. At birth the humerus is ossified in nearly its whole length, only the extremities remaining cartilaginous. During the first year, sometimes before birth, ossification commences in the head of the bone, and during the third year the center for the greater tubercle, and during the fifth that for the lesser tubercle, make their appearance. By the sixth year the centers for the head and tubercles have joined, so as to form a single large epiphysis, which fuses with the body about the twentieth year. The lower end of the humerus is ossified as follows. At the end of the second year ossification begins in the capitulum, and extends medialward, to form the chief part of the articular end of the bone; the center for the medial part of the trochlea appears about the age of twelve. Ossification begins in the medial epicondyle about the fifth year, and in the lateral about the thirteenth or fourteenth year. About the sixteenth or seventeenth year, the lateral epicondyle and both portions of the articulating surface, having already joined, unite with the body, and at the eighteenth year the medial epicondyle becomes joined to it.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="17"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

Passing upward and lateralward from the pubic tubercle is a well-defined ridge, forming a part of the pectineal line which marks the brim of the lesser pelvis: to it are attached a portion of the <B>inguinal falx</B> (<I>conjoined tendon of Obliquus internus and Transversus</I>), the <B>lacunar ligament</B> (<I>Gimbernat&#146;s ligament</I>), and the <B>reflected inguinal ligament</B> (<I>triangular fascia</I>). Medial to the pubic tubercle is the <B>crest,</B> which extends from this process to the medial end of the bone.

The point of junction of the crest with the medial border of the bone is called the <B>angle;</B> to it, as well as to the symphysis, the superior crus of the subcutaneous inguinal ring is attached. The <B>medial border</B> is articular; it is oval, and is marked by eight or nine transverse ridges, or a series of nipple-like processes arranged in rows, separated by grooves; they serve for the attachment of a thin layer of cartilage, which intervenes between it and the interpubic fibrocartilaginous lamina. The <B>lateral border</B> presents a sharp margin, the <B>obturator crest,</B> which forms part of the circumference of the obturator foramen and affords attachment to the obturator membrane.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="16"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;The <B>Lateral Portion</B> of the ascending ramus has three surfaces: superior, inferior, andposterior. The <B>superior surface</B> presents a continuation of the pectineal line, already mentioned as commencing at the pubic tubercle. In front of this line, the surface of bone is triangular in form, wider laterally than medially, and is covered by the Pectineus.

It presents below a deep notch, the <B>acetabular notch,</B> which is continuous with a circular non-articular depression, the <B>acetabular fossa,</B> at the bottom of the cavity: this depression is perforated by numerous apertures, and lodges a mass of fat. The notch is converted into a foramen by the transverse ligament; through the foramen nutrient vessels and nerves enter the joint; the margins of the notch serve for the attachment of the ligamentum teres.

At birth, the three primary centers are quite separate, the crest, the bottom of the acetabulum, the ischial tuberosity, and the inferior rami of the ischium and pubis being still cartilaginous. By the seventh or eighth year, the inferior rami of the pubis and ischium are almost completely united by bone. About the thirteenth or fourteenth year, the three primary centers have extended their growth into the bottom of the acetabulum, and are there separated from each other by a Y-shaped portion of cartilage, which now presents traces of ossification, often by two or more centers. One of these, the <I>os acetabuli,</I> appears about the age of twelve, between the ilium and pubis, and fuses with them about the age of eighteen; it forms the pubic part of the acetabulum. The ilium and ischium then become joined, and lastly the pubis and ischium, through the intervention of this Y-shaped portion. At about the age of puberty, ossification takes place in each of the remaining portions, and they join with the rest of the bone between the twentieth and twenty-fifth years.

From this description it will be seen that the cavity of the lesser pelvis is a short, curved canal, considerably deeper on its posterior than on its anterior wall. It contains, in the fresh subject, the pelvic colon, rectum, bladder, and some of the organs of generation.

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;The size of the pelvis varies not only in the two sexes, but also in different members of the same sex, and does not appear to be influenced in any way by the height of the individual. Women of short stature, as a rule, have broad pelves. Occasionally the pelvis is equally contracted in all its dimensions, so much so that all its diameters measure 12.5 mm. less than the average, and this even in well-formed women of average height. The principal divergences, however, are found at the superior aperture, and affect the relation of the antero-posterior to the transverse diameter. Thus the superior aperture may be elliptical either in a transverse or an antero-posterior direction, the transverse diameter in the former, and the antero-posterior in the latter, greatly exceeding the other diameters; in other instances it is almost circular.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="12"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

The angle is widest in infancy, and becomes lessened during growth, so that at puberty it forms a gentle curve from the axis of the body of the bone. In the adult, the neck forms an angle of about 125&#176; with the body, but this varies in inverse proportion to the development of the pelvis and the stature. In the female, in consequence of the increased width of the pelvis, the neck of the femur forms more nearly a right angle with the body than it does in the male. The angle decreases during the period of growth, but after full growth has been attained it does not usually undergo any change, even in old age; it varies considerably in different persons of the same age. It is smaller in short than in long bones, and when the pelvis is wide. In addition to projecting upward and medialward from the body of the femur, the neck also projects somewhat forward; the amount of this forward projection is extremely variable, but on an average is from 12&#176; to 14&#176;.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="4"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;The <B>Greater Trochanter</B> (<I>trochanter major; great trochanter</I>) is a large, irregular, quadrilateral eminence, situated at the junction of the neck with the upper part of the body. It is directed a little lateralward and backward, and, in the adult, is about 1 cm. lower than the head. It has two surfaces and four borders. The <B>lateral surface,</B> quadrilateral in form, is broad, rough, convex, and marked by a diagonal impression, which extends from the postero-superior to the antero-inferior angle, and serves for the insertion of the tendon of the Glut&#230;us medius. Above the impression is a triangular surface, sometimes rough for part of the tendon of the same muscle, sometimes smooth for the interposition of a bursa between the tendon and the bone. Below and behind the diagonal impression is a smooth, triangular surface, over which the tendon of the Glut&#230;us maximus plays, a bursa being interposed. The <B>medial surface,</B> of much less extent than the lateral, presents at its base a deep depression, the <B>trochanteric fossa</B> (<I>digital fossa</I>), for the insertion of the tendon of the Obturator externus, and above and in front of this an impression for the insertion of the Obsturator <!-- PAGE NUM="245" -->internus and Gemelli. The <B>superior border</B> is free; it is thick and irregular, and marked near the center by an impression for the insertion of the Piriformis. The <B>inferior border</B> corresponds to the line of junction of the base of the trochanter with the lateral surface of the body; it is marked by a rough, prominent, slightly curved ridge, which gives origin to the upper part of the Vastus lateralis. The <B>anterior border</B> is prominent and somewhat irregular; it affords insertion at its lateral part to the Glut&#230;us minimus. The <B>posterior border</B> is very prominent and appears as a free, rounded edge, which bounds the back part of the trochanteric fossa.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="7"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;The <B>Lesser Trochanter</B> (<I>trochanter minor; small trochanter</I>) is a conical eminence, which varies in size in different subjects; it projects from the lower and back part of the base of the neck.

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;A prominence, of variable size, occurs at the junction of the upper part of the neck with the greater trochanter, and is called the <B>tubercle of the femur;</B> it is the point of meeting of five muscles: the Glut&#230;us minimus laterally, the Vastus lateralis below, and the tendon of the Obturator internus and two Gemelli above. Running obliquely downward and medialward from the tubercle is the <B>intertrochanteric line</B> (<I>spiral line of the femur</I>); it winds around the medial side of the body of the bone, below the lesser trochanter, <!-- PAGE NUM="246" -->and ends about 5 cm. below this eminence in the linea aspera. Its upper half is rough, and affords attachment to the iliofemoral ligament of the hip-joint; its lower half is less prominent, and gives origin to the upper part of the Vastus medialis. Running obliquely downward and medialward from the summit of the greater trochanter on the posterior surface of the neck is a prominent ridge, the <B>intertrochanteric crest.</B> Its upper half forms the posterior border of the greater trochanter, and its lower half runs downward and medialward to the lesser trochanter. A slight ridge is sometimes seen commencing about the middle of the intertrochanteric&#146; crest, and reaching vertically downward for about 5 cm. along the back part of the body: it is called the <B>linea quadrata,</B> and gives attachment to the Quadratus femoris and a few fibers of the Adductor magnus. Generally there is merely a slight thickening about the middle of the intertrochanteric crest, marking the attachment of the upper part of the Quadratus femoris.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="9"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;The <B>linea aspera</B> <A HREF="/107/illus245.html">(Fig. 245)</A> is a prominent longitudinal ridge or crest, on the middle third of the bone, presenting a medial and a lateral lip, and a narrow rough, intermediate line. Above, the linea aspera is prolonged by three ridges. The lateral ridge is very rough, and runs almost vertically upward to the base of the greater trochanter. It is termed the <B>gluteal tuberosity,</B> and gives attachment to part of the Glut&#230;us maximus: its upper part is often elongated into a roughened crest, on which a more or less well-marked, rounded tubercle, the <B>third trochanter,</B> is occasionally developed. The intermediate ridge or <B>pectineal line</B> is continued to the base of the lesser trochanter and gives attachment to the Pectineus; the medial ridge is lost in the intertrochanteric line; between these two a portion of the Iliacus is inserted. Below, the linea aspera is prolonged into two ridges, enclosing between them a triangular area, the <B>popliteal surface,</B> upon which the popliteal artery rests. Of these two ridges, the lateral is the more prominent, and descends to the summit of the lateral condyle. The medial is less marked, especially at its upper part, where it is crossed by the femoral artery. It ends below at the summit of the medial condyle, in a small tubercle, the <B>adductor tubercle,</B> which affords insertion to the tendon of the Adductor magnus.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="11"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;From the <B>medial lip</B> of the linea aspera and its prolongations above and below, the Vastus medialis arises; and from the <B>lateral lip</B> and its upward prolongation, the Vastus lateralis takes origin. The Adductor magnus is inserted into the linea aspera, and to its lateral prolongation above, and its medial prolongation below. Between the Vastus lateralis and the Adductor magnus two muscles are attached&#151;viz., the Glut&#230;us maximus inserted above, and the short head of the Biceps femoris arising below. Between the Adductor magnus and the Vastus medialis four muscles are inserted: the Iliacus and Pectineus above; the Adductor brevis and Adductor longus below. The linea aspera is perforated a little below its center by the nutrient canal, which is directed obliquely upward.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="12"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two <I>borders</I> of the femur are only slightly marked: the <B>lateral border</B> extends from the antero-inferior angle of the greater trochanter to the anterior extremity of the lateral condyle; the <B>medial border</B> from the intertrochanteric line, at a point opposite the lesser trochanter, to the anterior extremity of the medial condyle.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="13"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

From the upper three-fourths of this surface the Vastus intermedius arises; the lower fourth is separated from the muscle by the intervention <!-- PAGE NUM="247" -->of the synovial membrane of the knee-joint and a bursa; from the upper part of it the Articularis genu takes origin. The <B>lateral surface</B> includes the portion between the lateral border and the linea aspera; it is continuous above with the corresponding surface of the greater trochanter, below with that of the lateral condyle: from its upper three-fourths the Vastus intermedius takes origin.

When, however, the femur is in its natural oblique position the lower surfaces of the two condyles lie practically in the same horizontal plane. The condyles are not quite parallel with one another; the long axis of the lateral is almost directly antero-posterior, but that of the medial runs backward and medialward. Their opposed surfaces are small, rough, and concave, and form the walls of the intercondyloid fossa. This fossa is limited above by a ridge, the <B>intercondyloid line,</B> and below by the central part of the posterior margin of the patellar surface. The posterior cruciate ligament of the knee-joint is attached to the lower and front part of the medial wall of the fossa and the anterior cruciate ligament to an impression on the upper and back part of its lateral wall. Each condyle is surmounted by an elevation, the epicondyle. The <B>medial epicondyle</B> is a large convex eminence to which the tibial collateral ligament of the knee-joint is attached. At its upper part is the adductor tubercle, already referred to, and behind it is a rough impression which gives origin to the medial head of the Gastrocnemius. The <B>lateral epicondyle,</B> smaller and less prominent than the medial, gives attachment to the fibular collateral ligament of the knee-joint. Directly below it is a small depression from which a smooth well-marked groove curves obliquely upward and backward to the posterior extremity of the condyle. This groove is separated from the articular surface of the condyle by a prominent lip across which a second, shallower groove runs vertically downward from the depression. In the fresh state these grooves are covered with cartilage. The Popliteus arises from the depression; its tendon lies in the oblique groove when the knee is flexed and in the vertical <!-- PAGE NUM="248" -->groove when the knee is extended. Above and behind the lateral epicondyle is an area for the origin of the lateral head of the Gastrocnemius, above and to the medial side of which the Plantaris arises.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="15"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;The <B>articular surface</B> of the lower end of the femur occupies the anterior, inferior, and posterior surfaces of the condyles. Its front part is named the <B>patellar surface</B> and articulates with the patella; it presents a median groove which extends downward to the intercondyloid fossa and two convexities, the lateral of which is broader, more prominent, and extends farther upward than the medial. The lower and posterior parts of the articular surface constitute the <B>tibial surfaces</B> for articulation with the corresponding condyles of the tibia and menisci. These surfaces are separated from one another by the intercondyloid fossa and from the patellar surface by faint grooves which extend obliquely across the condyles. The lateral groove is the better marked; it runs lateralward and forward from the front part of the intercondyloid fossa, and expands to form a triangular depression. When the knee-joint is fully extended, the triangular depression rests upon the anterior portion of the lateral meniscus, and the medial part of the groove comes into contact with the medial margin of the lateral articular surface of the tibia in front of the lateral tubercle of the tibial intercondyloid eminence. The medial groove is less distinct than the lateral. It does not reach as far as the intercondyloid fossa and therefore exists only on the medial part of the condyle; it receives the anterior edge of the medial meniscus when the knee-joint is extended. Where the groove ceases laterally the patellar surface is seen to be continued backward as a semilunar area close to the anterior part of the intercondyloid fossa; this semilunar area articulates with the medial vertical facet of the patella in forced flexion of the knee-joint. The tibial surfaces of the condyles are convex from side to side and from before backward. Each presents a double curve, its posterior segment being an arc of a circle, its anterior, part of a cycloid.<A NAME="txt61">&nbsp;</A><A HREF="/107/59.html#note61">61</A></TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="16"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

The various parts of the femur taken together form a single mechanical structure wonderfully well-adapted for the efficient, economical transmission of the loads from the acetabulum to the tibia; a structure in which every element contributes its modicum of strength in the manner required by theoretical mechanics for maximum efficiency.&#148; &#147;The internal structure is everywhere so formed as to provide in an efficient manner for all the internal stresses which occur due to the load on the femur-head. Throughout the femur, with the load on the femur-head, the bony material is arranged in the paths of the maximum internal stresses, which are thereby resisted with the greatest efficiency, and hence with maximum economy of material.&#148; &#147;The conclusion is inevitable that the inner structure and outer form of the femur are governed by the conditions of maximum stress to which the bone is subjected normally by the preponderant load on the femur-head; that is, by the body weight transmitted to the femur-head through the acetabulum.&#148; &#147;The femur obeys the mechanical laws that govern other elastic bodies under stress; the relation between the computed internal stresses due to the load on the femur-head, and the internal structure of the different portions of the femur is in very close agreement with the theoretical relations that should exist between stress and structure for maximum economy and efficiency; and, therefore, it is believed that the following laws of bone structure have been demonstrated for the femur:</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="17"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;In general, the trabecul&#230; of the tensile system are lighter in structure than those of the compressive system in corresponding positions. The significance of the difference in thickness of these two systems is that the thickness of the trabecul&#230; varies with the intensity of the stresses at any given point. Comparison of <A HREF="/107/illus247.html">Fig. 247</A> with <A HREF="/107/illus251.html">Fig. 251</A> will show that the trabecul&#230; of the compressive system carry heavier stresses than those of the tensile system in corresponding positions. For example, the maximum tensile stress at section 8 <A HREF="/107/illus251.html">(Fig. 251)</A> in the outermost fiber is 771 pounds per square inch, and at the corresponding point on the compressive side the compressive stress is 954 pounds per square inch. Similar comparisons may be made at other points, which confirm the conclusion that the thickness and closeness of spacing of the trabecul&#230; varies in proportion to the intensity of the stresses carried by them.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="29"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;It will be seen that the trabecul&#230; lie exactly in the paths of the maximum tensile and compressive stresses (compare <A HREF="/107/illus247.html">Figs. 247,</A> <A HREF="/107/illus248.html">248</A> and <A HREF="/107/illus251.html">251</A>), and hence these trabecul&#230; carry these stresses in the most economical manner.

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;<A HREF="/107/illus249.html">Fig. 249</A> shows a longitudinal frontal section through the left femur, which is the mate of the right femur on which the mathematical analysis was made.

In the shaft there is very little if any material in the central space, practically the only material near the neutral plane being in the compact bone, but lying at a distance from the neutral axis. This conforms to the requirement of mechanics for economy, as a minimum of material is provided for resisting shearing stresses where these stresses are a minimum.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="37"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;37</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

The trabecul&#230; of the former rise from the inner wall of the shaft and continue in perfectly straight lines parallel to the axis of the shaft and proceed to the epiphyseal line, whence they continue in more or less curved lines to meet the articular surface of the knee-joint at right angles at every point. Near the center there are a few thin, delicate, longitudinal trabecul&#230; which spring from the longitudinal trabecul&#230; just described, to which they are joined by fine transverse filaments that lie in planes parallel to the sagittal plane.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="42"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;42</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;As the distal end of the femur is approached the shaft gradually becomes thinner until the articular surface is reached, where there remains only a thin shell of compact bone.

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;<I>Significance of the Inner Architecture of the Distal Part of the Femur.</I>&#151;The function of the lower end of the femur is to transmit through a hinged joint the loads carried by the femur. For stability the width of the bearing on which the hinge action occurs should be relatively large. For economy of material the expansion of the end bearing should be as lightly constructed as is consistent with proper strength. In accordance with the principles of mechanics&#133; &#133;, <!-- PAGE NUM="255" -->the most efficient manner in which stresses are transmitted is by the arrangement of the resisting material in lines parallel to the direction in which the stresses occur and in the paths taken by the stresses. Theoretically the most efficient manner to attain these objects would be to prolong the innermost filaments of the bone as straight lines parallel to the longitudinal axis of the bone, and gradually to flare the outer shell of compact bone outward, and continuing to give off filaments of bone parallel to the longitudinal axis as the distal end of the femur is approached. These filaments should be well-braced transversely and each should carry its proportionate part of the total load, parallel to the longitudinal axis, transmitting it eventually to the articular surface, and in a direction perpendicular to that surface.&#148;</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="48"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;48</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;Referring to <A HREF="/107/illus249.html">Fig. 249,</A> it is seen that the large expansion of the bone is produced by the gradual transition of the hollow shaft of compact bone to cancellated bone, resulting in the production of a much larger volume.

The proximal part consists of a series of more or less cubical bones which allow a slight amount of gliding on one another and are chiefly concerned in distributing forces transmitted to or from the bones of the arm or leg. The middle part is made up of slightly movable long bones which assist the carpus or tarsus in distributing forces and also give greater breadth for the reception of such forces. The separation of the individual bones from one another allows of the attachments of the Interossei and protects the dorsi-palmar and dorsi-plantar vascular anastomoses. The terminal portion is the most movable, and its separate elements enjoy a varied range of movements, the chief of which are flexion and extension.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="1"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;The function of the hand and foot are, however, very different, and the general similarity between them is greatly modified to meet these requirements. Thus the foot forms a firm basis of support for the body in the erect posture, and is therefore more solidly built up and its component parts are less movable on each other than those of the hand. In the case of the phalanges the difference is readily noticeable; those of the foot are smaller and their movements are more limited than those of the hand. Very much more marked is the difference between the metacarpal bone of the thumb and the metatarsal bone of the great toe. The metacarpal bone of the thumb is constructed to permit of great mobility, is directed at an acute angle from that of the index finger, and is capable of a considerable range <!-- PAGE NUM="277" -->of movements at its articulation with the carpus. The metatarsal bone of the great toe assists in supporting the weight of the body, is constructed with great solidity, lies parallel with the other metatarsals, and has a very limited degree of mobility. The carpus is small in proportion to the rest of the hand, is placed in line with the forearm, and forms a transverse arch, the concavity of which constitutes a bed for the Flexor tendons and the palmar vessels and nerves. The tarsus forms a considerable part of the foot, and is placed at right angles to the leg, a position which is almost peculiar to man, and has relation to his erect posture. In order to allow of their supporting the weight of the body with the least expenditure of material the tarsus and a part of the metatarsus are constructed in a series of arches (<A HREF="/107/illus290.html">Figs. 290,</A> <A HREF="/107/illus291.html">291</A>), the disposition of which will be considered after the articulations of the foot have been described.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="2"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD><DIV ALIGN="center"><B>(Ossa Sesamoidea)</B></DIV><BR><BR><B>Sesamoid bones</B> are small more or less rounded masses embedded in certain tendons and usually related to joint surfaces. Their functions probably are to modify pressure, to diminish friction, and occasionally to alter the direction of a muscle pull. That they are not developed to meet certain physical requirements in the adult is evidenced by the fact that they are present as cartilaginous nodules in the fetus, and in greater numbers than in the adult. They must be regarded, according to Thilenius, as integral parts of the skeleton phylogenetically inherited.
<A NAME="txt66">&nbsp;</A><A HREF="/107/67.html#note66">66</A> Physical necessities probably come into play in selecting and in regulating the degree of development of the original cartilaginous nodules. Nevertheless, irregular nodules of bone may appear as the result of intermittent pressure in certain regions, <I>e.g.,</I> the &#147;rider&#146;s bone,&#148; which is occasionally developed in the Adductor muscles of the thigh.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="1"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sesamoid bones are invested by the fibrous tissue of the tendons, except on the surfaces in contact with the parts over which they glide, where they present smooth articular facets.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="2"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the upper extremity the sesamoid bones of the joints are found only on the palmar surface of the hand. Two, of which the medial is the the larger, are constant at the metacarpophalangeal joint of the thumb; one is frequently present in the corresponding joint of the little finger, and one (or two) in the same joint of the index finger. Sesamoid bones are also found occasionally at the metacarpophalangeal joints of the middle and ring fingers, at the interphalangeal joint of the thumb and at the distal interphalangeal joint of the index finger.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="3"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the lower extremity the largest sesamoid bone of the joints is the patella, developed in the tendon of the Quadriceps femoris. On the plantar aspect of the foot, two, of which the medial is the larger, are always present at the metatarsophalangeal <!-- PAGE NUM="278" -->joint of the great toe; one sometimes at the metatarsophalangeal joints of the second and fifth toes, one occasionally at the corresponding joint of the third and fourth toes, and one at the interphalangeal joint of the great toe.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="4"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sesamoid bones apart from joints are seldom found in the tendons of the upper limb; one is sometimes seen in the tendon of the Biceps brachii opposite the radial tuberosity. They are, however, present in several of the tendons of the lower limb, viz., one in the tendon of the Peron&#230;us longus, where it glides on the cuboid; one, appearing late in life, in the tendon of the Tibialis anterior, opposite the smooth facet of the first cuneiform bone; one in the tendon of the Tibialis posterior, opposite the medial side of the head of the talus; one in the lateral head of the Gastrocnemius, behind the lateral condyle of the femur; and one in the tendon of the Psoas major, where it glides over the pubis. Sesamoid bones are found occasionally in the tendon of the Glut&#230;us maximus, as it passes over the greater trochanter, and in the tendons which wind around the medial and lateral malleoli.</TD><TD VALIGN= TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME ="5"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>
